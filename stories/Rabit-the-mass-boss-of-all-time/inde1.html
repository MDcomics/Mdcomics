                    Once up on a time, there was a boy named Mohan Datta. He was an orphan. He used to live in a rented house in which he payed rent with part time job as a daily worker for a shop. After finishing his work, he daily used to go to a scientist who have nearly 400 awards and 17 patent rights. His name is Vishwanadhan. Everyone calls him vishwa. Vishwa teaches Datta abot Mechanical engineering and robotics. One day a very well known and popular scientist named Kelvin came to vishwa and asked to find the age for some objects he gave. Vishwa said that he could do it but he wanted to test his student Datta. Vishwa gave those objects to Datta and said to find its age with the method called " carbondating ". Datta easily found it. Vishwa then praised him and kelvin to praised him. Kelvin was very impressed of Datta and gave him two stones. He explained that these stones are two peices of a rock which is in round shape. He also said a theory that is there were eight stones remaining to make it as a ball. Datta didn't understood anything and nodded for what he said. He then went to his home. He was so tired and went to bath. When he turned on the shower, those water went through his skin without even a single scratch. <a href="inde2.html"><button class="btn btn1">Episode-2</button> </a> <br><br>
