                When he turned on the shower, those water went through his skin without even a single scratch. Datta felt weird. But he immideatly went outta bathroom and went to the place he kept those two stones. He took those two stones into his both hands and thought that weird thing happened because of those stones. He tried to throw 'em awy but, those stones went into his hands. He got fainted and then slept in the bed. When he woke up, it's already late for his school. He saw the clock and tried to take off his hands from pillow. But, his hand got stuck to that pillow. He took of his hand very hardly and observed a hole with some smoke at that spot where he kept his hand. He then doubted and expanded his fingers. Suddenly, a lava rope came from the inner core of earth. He felt very proudly that he was a super hero. But to disturb his happiness, His school staff called him that he was absent. He said that he got fever and cut the call. He then got a call from his shop owner saying to come to shop today. Datta asked that how did he knew that Datta skipped school today. Shop owner said that he spotted his bicycle. Datta said Ok and sadly went to the shop. Actually shop owner doesn't called to work. He called to Datta to say that he fired him and joined new one. When Datta went to shop, he got to know about it. His angry levels reached peaks. But he controlled it. He then Went to his house. While going to house, he observed a gangster group harasing a woman. He used his powers and saved that girl. He accidentally killed one of the member. He then went to home not realising that he just killed a V.I.P member. <a href="inde2.html"><button class="btn btn1">Episode-3</button> </a> <br><br>
